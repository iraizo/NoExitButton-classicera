# NoExitButton-classicera
This is more of a meme than anything but the wow classic hardcore addon cannot store some information  
when not logging out and exiting the game in the character screen  
so this just removes the exit game button

### Installation
- ![Download the repository](https://github.com/iraizo/NoExitButton-classicera/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
- Rename the folder to `NoExitButton` 
- Move the folder to your Addons folder
